degit is a scaffolding tool
a scaffolding tool gives you a project
that has certain things already

npx is npm but a different command, npm installs packages locally
locally local in one project, or globally for all projects
npx is used to always get the newest one instead of having an outdated version globally installed
for something like svelte you want to make sure you always get updated version
whereas for nodemon it is not necessary

npx takes it online and removes it once it has been cached

npx degit sveltejs/template my-svelte-project
cd my-svelte-project
npm install
npm run dev

npm run build
runs the build script

npm run start
is intended for production, so it is now being served on port 8080

npm run dev
starts the project on localhost:8080 and watches for changes and updates the page
without needing to refresh the page.

setupTypeScript sets up the svelte project for typescript instead of js
makes typescript support available
adds a tsconfig folder
deletes the scripts folder and contents

the structure of pages and components folders is not something you need to adhere to
but many different companies follow this structure

.svelte files are capitalized
