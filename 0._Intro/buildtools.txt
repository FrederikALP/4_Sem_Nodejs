degit is a scaffolding tool
a scaffolding tool gives you a project
that has certain things already

npx is npm but a different command, npm installs packages locally
locally local in one project, or globally for all projects
npx is used to always get the newest one instead of having an outdated version globally installed
for something like svelte you want to make sure you always get updated version
whereas for nodemon it is not necessary

npx takes it online and removes it once it has been cached

npx degit sveltejs/template my-svelte-project
cd my-svelte-project
npm install
npm run dev

setupTypeScript sets up the svelte project for typescript instead of js
makes typescript support available
adds a tsconfig folder
deletes the scripts folder and contents
