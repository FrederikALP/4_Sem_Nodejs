There are different ways to do client routing with svelte
npm.js.com/package/page 
Allows you to define the routes, set a variable and set that page to be displayed
It handles for you which component to display when it hits that route

Anders made his own too, its a navigator which takes the navbar
and handles the route, when you click the page it creates a store

npm.js.com/package/svelte-navigator
npm i svelte-navigator to install
Anders would go with this one

npm.js.com/package/svelte-routing

both of them takes a navbar where you can link to things
explanations of them are also on their respective pages

"start": "sirv public --no-clear --single" 
if you add --single to the start script, it tells the script/function sirv that it is a single page application
